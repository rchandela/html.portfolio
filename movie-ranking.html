<p I chanced upon this movie on Amazon Prime completely by accident and what a find it was.
Blue Ruin is about the how difficult it is for one to break the vicious cycle of violence.<br />What are the words that come to my mind when I think of this movie?<br /> Here you go:<br />Dark<br />Slow Burn<br />Intense<br />
</p>
<h3>Cadillac Records</h3>

<p>I love blues and jazz music but to get a lesson on it history and how the pioneers of this music influences generations of future musicians, this is a must watch.<br />Etta James<br />Muddy Waters<br />Little Walters<br />Willie Dixon<be />and many more</p>
<p>All of these got a chance to record their music, due to the large hertedness of Leonard Chess, the founder of CHESS RECORDS</p>
<h3>Bones and All</h3>

<p>If you are in a mood for the bizzare, the unthinkable and want to be blown by the unknown, watch this love story of two young cannibals.<br />Tarantino! You got competition!</p>
